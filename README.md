#Little Lemon Restaurant API Project
Welcome to the Little Lemon Restaurant API project! This project provides a fully functioning API that allows client application developers to build web and mobile applications for the restaurant. The API is built using Django Rest Framework (DRF) for handling API endpoints and Djoser for user authentication and token generation.

#Overall Capabilities
The Little Lemon Restaurant API offers a wide range of capabilities to support various user roles and functionalities:

User Registration and Authentication: Users can register with the API by providing their name, email, and password. The API handles user authentication and token generation through Djoser, allowing users to obtain access tokens for further API calls.

Menu Items Management: Customers and delivery crew can browse the list of menu items available. Managers have additional privileges to create, update, and delete menu items. Customers can add menu items to their cart.

User Role Management: Managers can create and manage two user groups - "Manager" and "Delivery crew." Users can be assigned to these groups or removed from them.

Cart Management: Customers can view the current items in their cart and add new items. They can also clear the cart by deleting all items.

Order Placement: Customers can place orders, which include items from their cart. Upon order placement, the items are moved from the cart to the order items table.

Order Management: Customers can view their own orders, while managers can view all orders placed by users. Managers can also update orders by assigning delivery crew and changing order status.

Delivery Status Management: Delivery crew can view orders assigned to them and update the delivery status (0 - out for delivery, 1 - delivered) for the orders they are handling.

#Technologies Used
The Little Lemon Restaurant API is built using the following technologies:

Django: A powerful and popular web framework for building web applications in Python.

Django Rest Framework (DRF): An extension of Django that simplifies building RESTful APIs, providing serializers, views, and other utilities.

Djoser: A Django app that provides user authentication endpoints, including user registration and token generation.

Pipenv: A virtual environment manager for Python projects, used for managing dependencies.
